    - Added LocalizableText asset type to demonstrate use of
      HyperText.InputTextSource. You can access it from Assets -> Create ->
      Candlelight -> Localizable Text.
    - Added default styles serializable property to HyperText. If you select
      HyperText.cs, you can set a value here that will be assigned to any new
      HyperText instance when it is first created.
    - Fixed bug causing inherited quad styles to render at the wrong size if
      the parent style sheet used a different font size.
    - Library updates.

    - Plug-in now supports WinRT and Windows Phone platforms.
    - Library updates.
1.3.1:
    - Fixed bug causing run-time error on AOT platforms.

      You may have to reconfigure any quads that contained empty space.
    - Fixed text not appearing in Unity 4.6.5.
    - Fixed undo/redo of text changes not rebuilding geometry.
    - Fixed exception in editor when setting size scale of custom styles.
    - Assigning a Font to HyperText now overrides the Font assigned on its
      style sheet. You may have to remove references to default fonts (e.g.,
      Arial) on existing HyperText objects to recover old appearances.
    - Added properties to override default font face, color, and line spacing on
      HyperText.
    - HyperText styles can now inherit from one another! If a custom style is
      defined on a parent style, it can be overridden on a child style by
      redefining it. If a style sheet has several parents, the sheets at the end
      of the list have the highest priority.
